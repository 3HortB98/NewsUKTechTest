Used jetpack compose, hilt, retrofit, okhttp, moshi, coil, mockk
display list of coins in alphabetical order. (noticed that some names have blank space as first character so they appear first - wasnt sure if that is something i should check for and remove that starting blank space)
click on coin and dialog will show some extra info
refresh button that refreshes network call
some unit tests

#### Things to improve if more time:
- add more items to the coin details that are displayed
- some Ui tests
- some more unit test
- improve the theme and the designs of what is displayed as spent more time on functionality
- error handling - be more specific and improve the info on what is displayed/logged
